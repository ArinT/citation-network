Computer Journal 7: 308\u2013313, 1965. 7 APPENDIX 7.1 HLCt instantiation The appendix presents pseudo code examples for employing HLCts in a geometry model. The examples describe the overall characteristics of the main functions needed for HLCt instantiation. The function GetReference() is used to retrieve information regarding references which are required to instantiate a given HLCt. The function\u2019s input are a string (called MyPart in the example) which is the name of the part where the HLCt will be instantiated, and the type of list that is needed (MyListType). The instantiation process is described in Instantiate(). The part name is used to retrieve the references needed (GetReference()) to identify the HLCt to instantiate (Knowledge Base), and to control the positioning in space of the newly generated instance (Position()). 7.1.1 GetReference() The function GetReference() must be called prior to a new HLCt instantiation. It retrieves the name of each reference (ReferenceList(i)) from the knowledge base and lastly finds and returns the corresponding geometric references (Reference(i)). The lists are stored in the knowledge base. GetReference(MyPart, MyListType) ReferencesList = Get MyListType of references connected to MyPart in Knowledge Base For i = 1 to Size of ReferenceList loop Reference(i) = Find(ReferenceList(i) End loop End GetReference 7.1.2 Instantiate() The function Instantiate() generates a new instance of a given HLCt in a newly created part of the model. The part is renamed in accordance with the function input string (NewPart). The knowledge of which HLCt to instantiate is stored in the knowledge base and is then instantiated.

(7) are calculated from the Eq. (10). In the next section, two different case studies of the MOO problems of the microchannel heat sink designs based on the prioritized preferences are considered. 5 OPTIMIZATION OF MICROCHANNEL HEAT SINKS BASED ON PRIORITIZED PREFERENCES In this section, various preference functions are defined and modeled in terms of the Pareto-optimal solutions. A first case study considers the preferences in terms of uni-objective function while a second case study takes multiple objective functions into account in the definition of the preference function. The performance functions will be formulated based on the preferences in various levels of priorities and the optimal solutions will be discussed. 5.1 CASE 1: PRIORITIZED PREFERENCES BASED ON UNI-OBJECTIVE FUNCTION The first case study considers three different uncorrelated preference functions. The first preference s1 is the Gaussian membership function in terms of the Pareto-optimal solutions from both the straight and U-shaped microchannel heat sink designs, shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6 respectively. This case study demonstrates the parametric models of fuzzy preferences. The high score of 0.9 is assigned to the first 20% of the smallest optimal thermal resistances; a lower ranked score of 0.7 is assigned to the next 20% of the optimal thermal resistances; the scores of 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1 are assigned to every subsequent 20% of the thermal resistances. Figure 7 (a) shows the assigned preferences and the corresponding Gaussian membership function for the preference of the thermal resistance. Similarly, the second preference s2 is modeled based on the optimal values of the pressure drops and shown in the subfigure (b). The last preference s3 is defined based on the optimal values of the heat flows. The highest score of 0.9 is assigned to the first 20% of the largest heat flows in the multi-objective design problems of both straight and U-shaped microchannel heat sink designs. The scores of 0.7 to 0.1 are then assigned to every subsequent 20% of the optimal heat flows. The Gaussian membership function of s3 is shown in Figure 7 (c). The shown parametric models are only for purpose of demonstration. The performance function shown in Eq. (12) is modeled with respect to multiple uncorrelated prioritized preferences and maximized to find the Pareto-optimal solution with the best performance. Max f\u2208\u03a9* R = p1s1 f1 ( )+ p2s2 f2 ( )+ p3s3 f3 ( ) (12) As a result, the solutions of the straight and U-shaped microchannel heat sink designs are listed in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively. The maximal channel widths, minimal channel numbers and maximal flow rates are considered for the highest priorities of heat flows, i.e. p3 =1 . The U-shaped design however shows higher heat flow q* = 0.733 W than the straight design. For the circumstances that the minimal pressure drops have the highest priorities, the minimal flow rates Q* =1.23\u00d710\u22126 m3 s\u22121 \f7 Copyright \u00a9 2012 by ASME (a) (b) (c) Figure 7.

The pressure drop of the straight microchannel design drops to \u0394P* = 4075 Pa but the U- shaped design still has a very high pressure drop \u0394P* =1.44 \u00d7104 Pa . The high pressure drops cannot be avoided in the geometries of U-shaped microchannel heat sinks. On the other hand, the largest channel number N* = 402 and the maximum flow rates Q* =1.77\u00d710\u22126 m3 s\u22121 should be considered for the highest priority of thermal resistances. The optimal widths of W * = 0.23 and W * = 0.69 are found for the straight and U-shaped designs respectively. The thermal resistances drop to lower than 1.11\u00d710\u22125 \u00b0Cm2 W\u22121 with the compromises of pressure drops and heat flows. 5.2 CASE 2: PRIORITIZED PREFERENCES BASED ON CORRELATED FUNCTION VALUES In the second case study, a correlated preference function s4 is modeled based on the multiple optimal values on the Pareto frontiers. The performance level is assigned based on the efficiency measure [22], which is defined as the ratio of the interfacial heat flow q* over the pumping power Q* \u00d7\u0394P* . Similar to the Case 1, the optimal efficiency measures are divided into five different levels. The measures higher than 22.7 are assigned with the highest preference score of 0.9. The measures in the intervals of [6.2, 22.7], [1.2, 6.2], and [0.2, 1.2] are assigned with the scores of 0.7, 0.5, and 0.3 respectively. The efficiency measures less than 0.2 are assigned with the lowest score of 0.1. The Gaussian \f8 Copyright \u00a9 2012 by ASME membership function s4 of the correlated preference is shown in Figure 8. As a result, the lower pressure drops and the higher heat flows are preferable while the flow rates have little effects on the preferences of the efficiency measures. The performance function is now formulated in terms of the preferences of the temperature resistances and the efficiency measures, shown as follows: Figure 8. Gaussian membership function of correlated preferences of flow rates, pressure drops, and heat flows. Table 4.

Max Q,f\u2208\u03a9* R = p1s1 f1 ( )+ p4s4 Q, f2, f3 ( ) (13) where the pressure drops and the heat flows are correlated in the preference function of s4 . Table 4 lists the optimal solutions of the correlated prioritized preferences for the straight microchannel heat sink designs. The maximal channel widths, smallest channel numbers, and minimal flow rates are found when the efficiency is the major priority because the pressure drop \u0394P* = 4075 Pa is minimal. When the priority p1 for minimal thermal resistance increases to 0.4, the maximal flow rate is determined producing a lower thermal resistance \u03b8* = 2.11\u00d710\u22126 m3 s-1 . On the other hand, the minimal channel widths and maximal channel numbers are desirable for the priority of thermal resistance higher than 0.6. Table 5 shows the optimal solutions of the U-shaped microchannel designs based on the correlated prioritized preferences. Similar to the straight channel designs, maximal channel widths and numbers are preferable for the stronger priorities of efficiency measures. For higher priorities of thermal resistances, W * = 0.69 and N* = 201 are found. In this section, one case study associated with the prioritized preferences of uni-objective functions has been discussed as the other case study considered the correlated prioritized preferences. The Gaussian membership functions have been utilized to model the fuzzy and correlated preference levels for both the straight and U-shaped microchannel heat sink designs. The optimal solutions are found to maximize the performance functions under different levels of preference priorities. The transitions of the optimal solutions between different priority levels have been observed and discussed. The results are useful for not only specific needs from different engineering disciplines but also alternating priority sequences under various situations. Comparing both case studies, we found the performances of thermal systems depend on the chosen preference functions and the priority between each preference. Therefore, it is important to define the preference functions associated with the desirable quality and quantity in each application and specify the priority values among each preference. 6 CONCLUSIONS The paper focuses on the single-phase liquid cooling for the electronic devices using the straight and the U-shaped multiple microchannel heat sink designs under different levels of preferences in various disciplines. The models have been experimentally and numerically studied. The performance responses, including thermal resistance, pressure drop, and heat flow, have been parametrically modeled in terms of the geometrical design variables and the experimental parameters. The MOO problems have been formulated to minimize the thermal resistance for the highest cooling performance, to minimize the pressure drop for the lowest pumping power, and to maximize the heat flow for the best cooling efficiency at the \f9 Copyright \u00a9 2012 by ASME interface between the fluid and heat spreader. The Pareto frontiers have been utilized to show the trade-off behaviors between the three objective functions. As a result, there are not best-for-all solutions in the multi-objective problems and the designs for the best performances depend on the priority levels of the desirable preferences. The fuzzy and correlated preferences have been modeled by the Gaussian membership functions. The shape parameters have been determined in terms of the assigned preferences associated with the Pareto-optimal solutions from the straight and U-shaped microchannel designs. Two case studies have been discussed. The first case considered the prioritized preferences based on uni-objective function values. The performance functions have been maximized to find the solutions for the different priority levels of minimizing the thermal resistances, minimizing the pressure drops, and maximizing the heat flows. The second case considered the preference function in terms of the correlated function values. The higher measures of the efficiency, which has been defined as the ratio of the heat flow over the pumping power, have been corresponded to the higher preference levels. The best performances have been found in terms of different priority levels of minimizing the thermal resistances and maximizing the efficiency measures. The methodology can be applied to the MOO problems of other thermal systems, which are mostly associated with various prioritized preferences in different disciplines. However, the proposed method is not only limited to the thermal systems. In fact, the optimization based on prioritized preferences can be extended to other design optimizations in mathematics, science and engineering, especially well for the complicated problems with multiple preferences from different disciplines. Though, the proposed method may contribute less for small problems with small amounts of objective, constraint, or preference functions. The essential future work is the considerations of the prioritized preferences in the field of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization.
